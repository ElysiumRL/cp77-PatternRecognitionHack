# Pattern Recognition Minigame
![](preview/Hackstartpreview.gif)

This custom hacking minigame is entirely made with [Redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript) using [Codeware](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware) and with the ***HUGE*** help of [Ink Playground](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-playground)

## What is it ?
Inspired by [this](https://sharkiller.ddns.net/nopixel_minigame/hackingdevice/) minigame, the objective is simple : Find the pattern above in this ever-moving/wrapping grid.
- Each correct guess unlocks a program
- Each mistake locks the program
- The Minigame is considered "Succeeded" if you unlock at least one program

# Beta
As seen above, this is a beta, a lot of small parts of the minigame haven't been polished yet. this includes possible UI bugs & possible mod incompatibilities. The UI has been tested on an 1920x1080 monitor on a 1080p resolution. I don't know the possible issues with other (possibly bigger) monitors/bigger resolution

## Debug
In order to access the minigame you can :
- Start hacking any access point
- (debug) : Hold "Choice_2" Button (Secondary Interaction button)

## Missing Features
These are the features that have yet to be made before full release
- Introduction Video Skip
- Random programs
- More Pattern types
- Random settings
