# Pattern Recognition Minigame
![](preview/Hackstartpreview.gif)

This custom hacking minigame is entirely made with [Redscript](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript) using [Codeware](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-codeware) and with the ***HUGE*** help of [Ink Playground](https://github.com/psiberx/cp2077-playground)

## What is it ?
Inspired by [this](https://sharkiller.ddns.net/nopixel_minigame/hackingdevice/) minigame, the objective is simple : Find the pattern above in this ever-moving/wrapping grid.
- Each correct guess unlocks a program
- Each mistake locks the program
- The Minigame is considered "Succeeded" if you unlock at least one program

## How to play
Just click on the grid.

# Beta
As seen above, this is a beta, a lot of small parts of the minigame haven't been polished yet. this includes :
- The horribly unreadable code (it's an absolute UI mess I promise I'll clean this up)
- Some texts overlapping images
- The possibility to skip the 11s introduction video not yet implemented

## Debug
In order to access the minigame you can :
- Start hacking any access point
- (the real dev debug) : Hold "Choice_2" Button (Secondary Interaction button)
